# SIEM Alert Triaging Process

In this guide, we delve into the process of alert triaging within a Security Operations Center (SOC). The steps outlined here are crucial for evaluating and prioritizing security alerts to effectively manage potential security incidents.

## What Is Alert Triaging?

Alert triaging is the process SOC analysts use to evaluate and prioritize security alerts generated by monitoring and detection systems. This process determines the level of threat and potential impact on an organization’s systems and data. Proper triaging involves reviewing, categorizing, and, if necessary, escalating alerts to ensure a timely and efficient response.

## The Ideal Triaging Process

### 1. Initial Alert Review

- **Review Alert Details**: Begin by thoroughly reviewing the alert, including metadata, timestamp, source/destination IP, affected systems, and the triggering rule or signature.
- **Analyze Logs**: Examine associated logs (network traffic, system, application) to understand the alert's context.

### 2. Alert Classification

- **Classify Alerts**: Categorize the alert based on severity, impact, and urgency using your organization’s predefined classification system.

### 3. Alert Correlation

- **Cross-Reference Alerts**: Correlate the alert with related alerts, events, or incidents to identify patterns or indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- **Gather Log Data**: Query the SIEM or log management system to collect relevant data.
- **Leverage Threat Intelligence**: Use threat intelligence feeds to check for known attack patterns or malware signatures.

### 4. Enrichment of Alert Data

- **Enrich Data**: Collect additional information, such as network packet captures, memory dumps, or file samples, to gain more context.
- **Use External Sources**: Utilize external threat intelligence sources or sandboxes to analyze suspicious files, URLs, or IP addresses.

### 5. Risk Assessment

- **Evaluate Risk**: Assess the potential risk and impact on critical assets, data, or infrastructure. Consider the value of affected systems, data sensitivity, and compliance requirements.

### 6. Contextual Analysis

- **Analyze Context**: Consider the context of the alert, including the affected assets and their criticality. Assess the security controls in place to determine if the alert indicates a potential control failure or evasion technique.
- **Compliance Considerations**: Evaluate relevant compliance requirements and regulations to understand the alert’s implications on legal and regulatory obligations.

### 7. Incident Response Planning

- **Initiate Incident Response**: If the alert is significant, document details and assign roles for incident response. Coordinate with other teams as needed.

### 8. Consultation with IT Operations

- **Consult IT Operations**: Engage with IT operations or relevant departments to gather additional context or resolve missing information. Understand non-malicious activities that might have triggered the alert.

### 9. Response Execution

- **Determine Response**: Based on the review, risk assessment, and consultation, decide on the appropriate response actions. If necessary, proceed with incident response actions.

### 10. Escalation

- **Trigger Escalation**: Identify triggers for escalation based on the organization's policies and the severity of the alert. Follow the escalation process and notify higher-level teams or management.

### 11. Continuous Monitoring

- **Monitor Progress**: Continuously monitor the situation and the progress of the incident response. Provide updates to escalated teams and collaborate closely.

### 12. De-escalation

- **Evaluate De-escalation**: Assess the need for de-escalation as the situation comes under control. Notify relevant parties of the actions taken and outcomes.

## Key Points

- **Comprehensive Review**: The initial review of alerts, including associated logs, is crucial for understanding the context and making informed decisions.
- **Classification and Correlation**: Effective classification and correlation of alerts help identify patterns and prioritize incidents.
- **Data Enrichment**: Enriching alert data with additional information provides deeper insights, enhancing the accuracy of the triaging process.
- **Risk and Context Analysis**: Assessing the risk and contextualizing alerts within the broader security landscape ensures a well-rounded response.
- **Collaboration and Escalation**: Effective communication and collaboration with IT operations and other teams, along with a structured escalation process, are essential for handling critical incidents.

## Conclusion

The SIEM alert triaging process is a fundamental aspect of SOC operations, requiring a systematic approach to evaluate and prioritize security alerts. By mastering the steps outlined above, SOC analysts can ensure that critical threats are identified and addressed promptly, safeguarding the organization's assets and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.
